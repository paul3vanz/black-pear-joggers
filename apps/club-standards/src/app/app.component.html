            How it works

          <p>
            There are four awards available; <strong>Bronze</strong>, <strong>Silver</strong>,
            <strong>Gold</strong> and <strong>Platinum</strong>. By completing three of the
            recognised events at a particular standard, you can achieve one of the awards.
            You donâ€™t have to take part, the scheme is there for those that want an incentive
            to improve their times and be recognised for their efforts.

        <p>
          All the following distances count towards BPJ Club Standards awards.
          Remember you only need to complete <strong>three</strong> of the
          <strong>five</strong> different events to earn an award:
        </p>

        <ul class="events">
          <li><strong>Mile</strong> <span>(including club <a href="https://bpj.org.uk/magic-mile/">magic mile</a>)</span></li>
          <li><strong>5K</strong> <span>(including <a href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk/worcester/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parkruns</a>)</span></li>
          <li><strong>10K</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Half Marathon</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Marathon</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Other than the exceptions for the mile,
          runs will only count if they are completed at events that can be found on the
            <a href="https://www.thepowerof10.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

          website (so no fun runs or training runs).
          These are events with a UK Athletics race licence.

        <p>
          The times for the standards depend on your age category and are based on Age Grading as used by

        <p>
          You can claim your award if in any calendar year you have been a member of the club throughout
          the period over which all the runs have taken place and you have the required standard for at
          least three of the five distances in your age category (your age counting as of the date of the run).
        </p>

        <p>
          Claim your award by filling in the <a href="javascript:void(0)" (click)="onClaimAwardClick()">claim award form</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          After checking, you will be presented with your certificate on a club night or other club event.
