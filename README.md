# Black Pear Joggers

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) using [Nrwl Nx](https://nrwl.io/nx).

## Nrwl Extensions for Angular (Nx)

Nx is an open source toolkit for enterprise Angular applications.

Nx is designed to help you create and build enterprise grade Angular applications. It provides an opinionated approach to application project structure and patterns.

## Quick Start & Documentation

[Watch a 5-minute video on how to get started with Nx.](http://nrwl.io/nx)

## Generate your first application

Run `ng generate app myapp` to generate an application. When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same CLI workspace. Read more [here](http://nrwl.io/nx).

## Development server

Run `ng serve --project=myapp` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project=myapp` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

`ng build --project=race-results --configuration production`

### Building on a modern Node

This workspace is on Angular 12, which predates Node 17. On anything newer
two things are needed:

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider npx nx build race-results --configuration production
```

Without the flag the build stops with `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED`, because the
webpack version behind Angular 12 hashes with MD4, which OpenSSL 3 no longer
allows. It is deliberately not baked into the `build` script, since the flag is
rejected outright by Node 16 and older.

Verified building all four apps this way on Node 22.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help
